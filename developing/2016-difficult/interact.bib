% ...26 studies were deemed as relevant. The main findings from these studies
% are: i) Bloom’s taxonomy has mostly been applied at undergraduate level for
% both design and assessment of software engineering courses; ii) software
% construction is the leading SE subarea in which Bloom’s taxonomy has been
% applied. The results clearly point out the usefulness of Bloom’s taxonomy in
% the SE education context.
