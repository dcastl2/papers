\section{Introduction}

An automated grading paradigm offers several advantages over traditional
paper-based subjective grading: it is generally less time-consuming; allows for
expeditious feedback to the student; makes it possible to correct systematic
errors made by a faulty grading scheme; and eases the creation of multiple,
customized assignments with little time expense. 

This paper begins with a discussion into the advantages of the
automated grading paradigm followed by a review of literature on existing
systems, then details both the design and design logic of the current automated
grading system based upon the needs of students, teachers, and teaching
assistants.  It then showcases a demonstration grading of two student codes
against their corresponding solution code and grading scheme. Finally, future
work on automated suggestion is discussed followed by a conclusion on the
holistic work.
