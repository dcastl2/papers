This paper discusses the design of Autograde, an automated system for grading
introductory-level computer science coursework. Autograde pre-processes source
files, compiles them, executes them, then captures their error and output
messages into files for automated assessment by parsing; grading scheme and
grammar files may be either written or generated and edited to customize the
grading process.  Furthermore, it constructs and uses a neural network trained
by annotated compilation and execution error and output data and Autograde
result data to identify programming challenges unique to the student and
generate future assignments designed to target the challenge areas.
