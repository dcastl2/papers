\section{Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{fail signal} for a matcher stream $M$ means this stream failed to match against the input.  
\item Likewise a \textbf{success signal} for $M$ means it succeeded fully in matching.
\item A \textbf{partial success signal} for $M$ means that it has succeeded up until the current iteration.
\item A \textbf{kill signal} send to $M$ indicates that $M$ should die, i.e. stop attempting to match.
  \end{itemize}
